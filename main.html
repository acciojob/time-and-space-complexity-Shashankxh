    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. An efficient algorithm aims to minimize time complexity, ensuring that it performs well even for large input sizes.</p>

    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. Efficient algorithms also consider memory usage. For example, an algorithm with <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n) means that the memory requirement grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
